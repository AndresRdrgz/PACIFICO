üìã SOLUTION 1: FAKE APPLY THE MIGRATION (RECOMMENDED)

This tells Django that the migration has been applied without actually running it.

üìã SOLUTION 2: REPLACE THE MIGRATION FILE

Replace the problematic migration with a safer version that checks for column existence.

üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
========================
1. Try SOLUTION 1 first (fake apply)
2. If that doesn't work, use SOLUTION 2 (replace migration file)
3. Always backup before making changes

üí° WHY THIS HAPPENED:
====================
The 'empresa' field was added to the model but the migration was created 
when the field already existed in the database, possibly due to:
- Manual database changes
- Previous migration that added the field
- Model changes not properly reflected in migrations

‚ö†Ô∏è  PREVENTION:
===============
- Always use 'makemigrations' after model changes
- Keep development and production databases in sync
- Test migrations on a copy of production data first

üöÄ QUICK FIX COMMAND FOR PRODUCTION:
